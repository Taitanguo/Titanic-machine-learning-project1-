# Titanic-machine-learning-project1-
project one
This project is mainly about analysis the data of Titanic to find suitable attributes
for decision tree, then predict whether a human would survive in titanic. In the
analysis part, boxplot of each attributes has been applied to find which attribute is
significant. And in the data clean process, all attribute which lost too much data
has been dropped. After data clean, new data used to feed decision tree.
Decision tree has been tested through test sets and the accuracy reached 81%.
Then, we analysis the decision tree and find several interesting results. Those
result used to reach the conclusion of titanic.
